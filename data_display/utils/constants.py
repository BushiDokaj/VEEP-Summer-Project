    Why we need this file?

    Typos can cause issues in strings when the strings are later evaluated for choices in the code.
    By using variables to represent strings we can use our text editors/IDE's to double check whether or not
    we are referencing the correct string (though some IDE's are smart enough to do this for us!).
